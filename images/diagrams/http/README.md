# Mermaid sequence diagrams

This directory includes SVG diagrams which are generated from [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax.
For example, the source `.mmd` file is a sibling of the generated SVG:

```plain
├── content-negotiation.mmd
└── content-negotiation.svg
```

## Converting to SVG

For any `.mmd` file, you may visit <https://www.mermaid`chart.com/> and export as SVG.
Alternatively, see the [CLI](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli) and other tools under <https://github.com/mermaid-js>.
